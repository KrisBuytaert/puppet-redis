Redis Puppet module

Not tested on Ubuntu only on CentOS

Still fighting with redis vs redis-server

 redis doesn't stop correctly .. the upstream rc scripts are broken and need 
 fixing but I don't have time now.

Example usage:

  Antipattern downloading unpackaged stuff
    $redis_interface = 'eth0'
    include redis

  Using Packages :

    require redis::params
    $redis_interface = 'eth1'
    include redis::package
    include redis::config
    include redis::service
